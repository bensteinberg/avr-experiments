avr-experiments
===============

My own repo for beginner AVR programming, starting out with a blinky program from https://github.com/hexagon5un/AVR-Programming.

At the moment, Makefiles specify the chip (attiny45) and programmer (usbtiny) I have.  Compile and upload like this:

    make flash_usbtiny

To come: how to install the toolchain (avr-gcc and avrdude).
